custom pre-commit hooks

Work in progress - intend to add custom pre-commit hooks here in the future.
- use `git diff --stat` to check for files with too many or too few changes?

## Requirements

To use these hooks, you first need to install pre-commit using the instructions here:
https://pre-commit.com/#install
